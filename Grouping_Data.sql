-- Itâ€™s important to identify the best customers, so write a SQL statement to return the order number (order_num in the OrderItems table) for all orders of at least 100 items

select order_num
from OrderItems 
group by order_num

-- Another way to determine the best customers is by how much they have spent. Write a SQL statement to return the order number (order_num in the OrderItems table) for all orders with a total price of at least 1000. Hint: for this one youâ€™ll need to calculate and sum the total (item_price multiplied by quantity). Sort the results by order number.

select order_num, sum(item_price * quantity) as final_price
from OrderItems 
group by order_num 
having final_price >= 1000
order by order_num;
